# Automation Cookbook

The Automation Cookbook, an initiative by the team that brought you [Test Automation University](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/), is a collection of free bite-sized videos aimed to upskill developers and test engineers of all experience levels. Anyone looking for quick answers to their test automation questions can use these recipes to solve everyday challenges.

The automation recipe videos range from 3-10 minutes in length and cover topics such as uploading a file, selecting from drop downs, interacting with alerts and push notifications, and more! Each recipe is covered with **Selenium Java** as well as **JavaScript with Cypress**.
